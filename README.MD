# [📣 ORENLE 📣](https://orenle.vercel.app)

Listen _in spanish_ 🇪🇸 what weekday you are currently living in. Another silly project brought to you by me.

## Tech

- Made with 🐶 [pug template](https://pugjs.org/).
- Uses ~~[Google text to speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech)~~ [Play.ht](https://play.ht/) to generate audio with AI 🎵
- Deployed in ▲ [vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## APP

Customize audio adding [`?q=something`](https://orenle.vercel.app?q=something) to the url.

## API

Acces the api in [`/audio`](https://orenle.vercel.app/audio):

- By default the current weekday is used.
- Add [`/audio?q=something`](https://orenle.vercel.app/audio?q=something) to customize.
